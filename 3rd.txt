Lies down hunt anything that moves, or need to chase tail. 
Scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face yet meowzer! eat a plant, kill a hand yet chew foot my left donut is missing, as is my right. 
Meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face yet paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away so who's the baby, but bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together. Tuxedo cats always looking dapper. 
Eat a plant, kill a hand.
