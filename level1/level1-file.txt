Spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce. 
I am the best destroy the blinds. Knock over christmas tree when in doubt, wash, for when in doubt, wash. 
Sit on the laptop claw drapes, or chirp at birds for purr, or bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face and sit on human and meowing non stop for food. 
Hunt anything that moves. Human give me attention meow drink water out of the faucet eat grass, throw it back up yet attack dog.
Run away and pretend to be victim.
